**Custom Notes:**
<b>To install:</b>
&nbsp; 1. Modify line 23 ("homepage") value in package.json to reflect the path of the calculator (e.g. https://mycalc.com/calc/ --> "/calc/")
&nbsp; 2. If using Apache make sure the directory containing the calculator has the necessary .htaccess settings for React
&nbsp; 3. From the client folder, run npm install and then run nmp run build to build the app
&nbsp; 4. After build, copy the contents of the new build folder to the path where the app should live
